## Python Package

### Installation

Install Proofly using pip:

```bash
pip install proofly
```

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Basic Usage

```python
from proofly import HealthAnalyzer
from proofly.models import DiabetesMetrics
from datetime import datetime

# Initialize the analyzer with custom configuration
analyzer = HealthAnalyzer(
    config={
        "logging_level": "INFO",
        "cache_enabled": True,
        "validation_mode": "strict"
    }
)

# Create metrics using the type-safe model
metrics = DiabetesMetrics(
    blood_glucose=120,
    hba1c=6.5,
    blood_pressure=130,
    timestamp=datetime.now()
)

# Analyze metrics and get predictions
prediction = analyzer.predict_risk(metrics)
print(f"Risk Level: {prediction.risk_level}")
print(f"Confidence Score: {prediction.confidence}")

# Get personalized recommendations
recommendations = analyzer.get_recommendations(metrics)
for rec in recommendations:
    print(f"- {rec.description}")
```

### API Reference

#### Core Classes

##### HealthAnalyzer
Main analysis engine for processing health metrics and generating insights.
```python
class HealthAnalyzer:
    def predict_risk(self, metrics: BaseMetrics) -> AnalysisResult:
        """Predict health risks based on provided metrics."""
        
    def get_recommendations(self, metrics: BaseMetrics) -> List[Recommendation]:
        """Generate personalized health recommendations."""
```

##### MetricConfig
Configuration management for analysis settings.
```python
class MetricConfig:
    """Handles analyzer configuration and validation settings."""
```

##### AnalysisResult
Container for analysis results and predictions.
```python
class AnalysisResult:
    """Stores and manages analysis outcomes."""
```

##### ReportGenerator
Utility for generating health reports and summaries.
```python
class ReportGenerator:
    """Creates detailed health reports from analysis results."""
```

#### Health Metric Models

- **DiabetesMetrics**: Blood glucose, HbA1c, blood pressure monitoring
- **HypertensionMetrics**: Blood pressure and heart rate tracking
- **COPDMetrics**: Respiratory function and symptoms
- **CKDMetrics**: Kidney function markers
- **CHFMetrics**: Heart failure indicators

#### Utility Classes

##### TrendAnalyzer
```python
class TrendAnalyzer:
    """Analyzes temporal patterns in health metrics."""
```

##### RiskCalculator
```python
class RiskCalculator:
    """Calculates health risk scores and probabilities."""
```

##### RecommendationEngine
```python
class RecommendationEngine:
    """Generates personalized health recommendations."""
```

##### DataValidator
```python
class DataValidator:
    """Validates and sanitizes input health data."""
```

### Advanced Configuration

```python
config = {
    "logging_level": "DEBUG",  # DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
    "cache_enabled": True,     # Enable result caching
    "cache_ttl": 3600,        # Cache timeout in seconds
    "validation_mode": "strict",  # strict or lenient
    "prediction_threshold": 0.85,  # Confidence threshold
    "api_timeout": 30         # API request timeout in seconds
}

analyzer = HealthAnalyzer(config=config)
```

### Error Handling

```python
from proofly.exceptions import ValidationError, AnalysisError

try:
    metrics = DiabetesMetrics(blood_glucose=500)  # Invalid value
except ValidationError as e:
    print(f"Validation failed: {e}")

try:
    prediction = analyzer.predict_risk(metrics)
except AnalysisError as e:
    print(f"Analysis failed: {e}")
```
